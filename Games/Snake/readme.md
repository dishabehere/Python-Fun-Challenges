This file contains high level instructions to build your own snake game.

Step 1: Set up your environment
Install Python on your system if you haven't already.

Step 2: Initialize Pygame and create the game window
Start by importing the turtle module and initialize it.
Define the dimensions for your game window.

Step 3: Create the snake
Define the initial position and size of the snake.
Create a function to draw the snake on the screen.

Step 4: Create the snake food
Define the position and size of the food.
Create a function to draw the food on the screen.

Step 5: Move the snake
Define the snake's speed.
Capture key press events to change the direction of the snake.
Update the snake's position based on its current direction.

Step 6: Detect collision with food
Check if the snake's head position matches the position of the food.
If a collision is detected, increase the length of the snake and reposition the food.

Step 7: Create a scoreboard
Keep track of the score.
Display the score on the game window.

Step 8: Detect collision with walls
Check if the snake's head hits the boundary of the game window.
If a collision is detected, end the game.

Step 9: Detect collision with tail
Check if the snake's head collides with any part of its tail.
If a collision is detected, end the game.

Step 10: Main game loop
Combine all the elements in a game loop that will run until the game ends.
Include a frame rate controller to make the game playable.

Step 11: Ending the game and restart option
Display an end game message when the snake hits the wall or itself.
Offer the player an option to restart the game.

Step 12: Finalize and test
Test your game thoroughly to ensure that all functions work correctly.
Refactor and clean up your code; add comments to make it readable.

This should give you a basic functional snake game. Please note that these instructions are quite high-level. If you need a more detailed code walkthrough, feel free to ask for specific parts of the game implementation!
